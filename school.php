While most company utilize third party background check companies to do education verification for them, there are instances wherein the checks are not completed or goes beyond your set deadline. Additionally, verification of employees being conducted by recruiters or HR employees are very limited since the verification requirements of schools (e.g preferred method or needed documents to process verification) have to be research individually. By using the PHverify.com database, recruiters can now do internal background check verification since information regarding the verification process of colleges and universities in metro manila can be accessed.</p>
