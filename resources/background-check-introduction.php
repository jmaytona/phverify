        <h4><u>Introduction</u></h4><br>
        <p>The pre employment background is a step in the recruitment or onboarding process of every company created to validate the information provided during the interview steps and compare it to the specific requirements of the companies. </p><br><br>
        <h4><u>What check are included in a typical Background check in the Philippines?</u></h4><br>
        <p>While each company would have its specific requirements that needs to be checked, the most common types of back ground check includes:</p>
        <div class="list-group">
            <a href="address-check.php" class="list-group-item list-group-item-action"><b>Address Check</b></a>
            <a href="identity-check.php" class="list-group-item list-group-item-action"><b>Identity Check</b></a>

        </div>
        <br><br>
        <h4><u>How is the background check being conducted?</u></h4><br>
        <p>The pre employment background check can either be 1) conducted by the Recruiters/HR representatives of the company or 2) endorsed to a third party background check company. The basis for almost all background checks conducted is a signed background investigation form that you accomplish once you pass the final interview or during your job offer.</p><br><br>
        <p>The usual contents of the background investigation form are dependent on what checks are required by the company however the standard information that’s always present in the form is the letter of authorization that you need to sign so that the employers would have your consent to conduct the background check.</p><br><br>
        <p>Additional information gathered for employment or education checks are the name of the institutions, inclusive dates of employment or education and/or the graduation date (for education) and the end date/clearance status (for employment). Some employers would also collect relevant documents from the employers or schools that you have declared. Example: You have declared Company A as an employer so the company might require for employment documents like Certificate of Employment, Resignation Letter or Clearance form to get the results of the background check faster.</p><br><br>
        <h4><u>How is the background check different from the pre employment requirements?</u></h4><br>
        <p>The pre employment requirements are the crucial documents collected for your employee/personnel file (sometimes called 201 file). These documents are primarily used for processing of your government mandated benefits such as TIN or Tax Forms, SSS or E1 forms etc. While some companies also require you to submit employment or educational documents as pre employment documents, it’s usually collected solely for your employee/personal file (201 file). The process is different from each company so It’s always advisable to check with your recruiter the purpose of the documents collected so you can prepare a photocopy of the document.</p><br><br>
